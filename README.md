# Project Euler

> [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

This repo tracks my attempts to solve the numerous problems and practice basic maths using Python and JavaScript.
